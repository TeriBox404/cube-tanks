# cube tanks
Cube tanks is a small local multyplayer game I am making.

!!!YOU HAVE TO HAVE NODE.JS INSTALED!!! https://nodejs.org/en

To play you nead to extract the cube tanks.zip.
Then you oppen the RUN.bat.
When this is done just go to the link shown in the cmd window(http://192.168.1.12:9026).

One computer acts like the server and every device connected to the same WiFi, will be abble to join.

# plans

Furst thing in my list is names and life system.
